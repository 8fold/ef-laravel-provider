> **Warning:** Repos prefixed with `ef` typically mean the package has many 8fold-specific constraints and very little documentation or support for non-8fold developed projects.

A base Laravel service provider primarily for use with sites developed and maintained by 8fold Practitioners.

As such, documentation will be thin on the ground and a long time coming.

## Terms

- `path`: A fully defined file location.

## Provides

As many default routes and implementations for various sites developed by 8fold Practitioners.

## Primary class and extension point
